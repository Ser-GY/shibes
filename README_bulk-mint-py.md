Now, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python script.py <address> <ticker> <amount> <interval_seconds> <num_loops>
```
Replace <address>, <ticker>, <amount>, <interval_seconds>, and <num_loops> with the actual values you want to use. For example:
```
python script.py 0x123456789abcdef ABC 100000000 180 5
```
This will run the specified number of loops (in this example, 5 times) with the provided arguments. Adjust the script and arguments based on your specific requirements.
